# API A3 - Excessive Data Exposure
![DATA-EXPOSURE](../assets/API-Top-10/A3-Excessive-Data-Exposure.svg)

## What is it?
An API is only supposed to return the required data to the front-end clients. Sometimes developers will make a mistake or implement HTTP parameter auto-binding that results in all data being returned to the client. 

This results in excessive data exposure that can be easily mined and exploited by attackers.

## What are specific examples?
    
- Scenario 1

    A mobile team uses the /api/articles/{articleId}/comments/{commentId} endpoint in the articles view to render comments metadata.

    Sniffing the mobile application traffic, an attacker finds out that other sensitive data related to commentâ€™s author is also returned.
    
    The endpoint implementation uses a generic toJSON() method on the User model, which contains PII, to serialize the object.

- Scenario 2
    
    An IOT-based surveillance system allows administrators to create users with different permissions.
    
    An admin created a user account for a new security guard that should only have access to specific buildings on the site. 
    
    Once the security guard uses his mobile app, an API call is triggered to: /api/sites/111/cameras in order to receive data about the available cameras and show them on the dashboard.
    
    The response contains a list with details about cameras in the following format: {"id":"xxx","live_access_token":"xxxx-bbbbb","building_id":"yyy"}. 
    
    While the client GUI shows only cameras which the security guard should have access to, the actual API response contains a full list of all the cameras in the site.

## Test case FAQs

### When is this test case applicable?
* Applicable to all API endpoints that return JSON data.

### How does it work?
- The response returned from the endpoint is screened for classified/sensitive data using trained machine learning model.
- The density of sensitive data (PII/PSI) present in the response is computed, and the response is assigned an appropriate risk level.

### What is the solution?
- Never rely on the client-side to filter sensitive data; this should be done at the API level.
- Cherry-pick the specific properties of the response you want to return. Avoid using generic methods such as to_json() and to_string().
- Classify sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) that your application works with. Review all API endpoints that return such information to see if these responses pose a security issue.
- Implement a schema-based response validation mechanism as an extra layer of security. As part of this mechanism define and enforce data returned by all API methods, including errors.
