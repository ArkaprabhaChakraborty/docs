## Contract Tests are Isolated, Fast, & Cheap

Contract testing is a lightweight form of API testing that strictly checks the content and format of requests/responses. Unlike functional tests, contract tests do not validate the logic or consumer flows of APIs.

Contract testing really focuses on ensuring that spec files such as Swagger or OpenAPI, properly fulfill contracts between API consumers and producers.

Contract tests don't require a full featured end-to-end environment, run in isolated/mocked environments, and are extremely fast & cheap.

They give developers confidence that services will run and perform as expected in production, without actually testing in production.

## Contract Tests Put APIs Through The Wringer
Contract tests identify numerous interoperability issues, and vulnerabilities in APIs, such as:
