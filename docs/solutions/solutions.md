## [Frictionless API Observability](./api-observability.md)

Levo’s frictionless & privacy-preserving *API Observability* solution, auto discovers and auto documents all your APIs.

![API Observability](../assets/api-observability.svg)

Below are the high level benefits:

- Instant, codeless, and agentless API Observability, powered by eBPF 
- Discover every API in your enterprise: north-south, east-west, shadow, legacy, rogue, partner, authenticated, unauthenticated, and more
- Auto generate OpenAPI specifications for all your APIs
- Track sensitive data flows (PII, PSI, PHI, etc.) in your APIs
- Continuously updated bill of materials (SBOM) for APIs - Services, APIs, Roles, & Scopes
- Privacy preserving technology ensures your API data stays within your premises/VPC

## [Codeless API Contract Testing](./api-contract-testing.md)
API endpoints have a defined schema (aka contract), that is often described in OpenAPI Specifications. The contract allows clients of the API endpoint to interact with it, without knowledge of the underlying implementation.

Contract testing (**aka Schema Conformance**) ensures that said contract matches the actual implementation of the API endpoint. Contract testing is a critical tool to detect breaking changes before they are deployed to production.

Below are the high level benefits:

- Ensure that the API implementation always matches the API contract specified in the OpenAPI / Swagger definition of the API  
- Prevent breaking changes to your APIs that impacts critical API integrations with your partners, external customers, and internal customers
- Test your APIs in isolation without having to stand up fully formed end-to-end testing environments
- Plug and play integration for all popular CI/CD platforms
- Ship resilient and regression free APIs to production

## [Codeless API Security Testing](./api-security-testing.md)
Don’t wait for your APIs to be attacked. Find and fix vulnerabilities in your APIs with automated security testing in CI/CD.

![API Security Testing](../assets/api-security-testing.svg)

Below are the high level benefits:

- Autogenerated API security tests that run in CI/CD alongside unit, and integration tests
- Comprehensive coverage for *OWASP API Top 10*, *Horizontal Authorization Bypass* (IDOR / BOLA), *Vertical Authorization Bypass* (BFLA), and Business Logic Abuse
- Codeless automated API testing framework similar to Postman, Newman, Karate etc.
- Plug and play integration for all popular CI/CD platforms
- Ship secure and regression free APIs to production
- Scale API security coverage & reduce costs
- Enable security to operate at the speed of business. Ship fast and stay secure
