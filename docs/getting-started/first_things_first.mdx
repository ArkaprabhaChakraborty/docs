## Components

Levo has two components: the Sensor and the Satellite. 

The Sensor is a user-space process, that uses <code>Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF)</code> to 
passively capture API traffic (full HTTP payloads) from Linux workloads. The sensor works on bare metal, 
virtual machine, and container formats.

The Satellite runs within the customer premises or VPC, and can be run alongside application workloads, 
or in a separate host. It uses sampled API traffic (API Traces) from the Sensor to:
- Auto discover API endpoints.
- Derive (OpenAPI) schema for the discovered API endpoints.
- Detect sensitive data (PII, PSI, etc.) present in API data.
- Annotate the derived schema with sensitive data types.
- Send the API schema to Levo SaaS for API Catalog building.
