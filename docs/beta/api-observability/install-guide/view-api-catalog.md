# View API Catalog
The [API Catalog](../../../concepts/api-catalog/api-catalog.md) in Levo.ai should be auto populated in a matter of minutes (after your API endpoints are being exercised consistently).

The API Catalog will contain your auto discovered API endpoints and their OpenAPI schemas, all grouped under the `Application Name` you chose earlier.

Congratulations! You have successfully auto discovered and auto documented API endpoints in your application.
